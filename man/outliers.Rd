\title{Calculate the T2 statistic for individual points}
\usage{
outliers(
  x,
  level = 0.95,
  robust = FALSE,
  type = c("t2data", "t2mean", "c2data")
)

plot_outliers(
  x,
  level = 0.95,
  robust = FALSE,
  type = c("t2data", "t2mean", "c2data"),
  labels = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix or data frame with two columns}

\item{level}{Either coverage probability (for type = "t2data" or "c2data") or
confidence level (for type = "t2mean").}

\item{robust}{If TRUE, then robust estimates of mean and covariance are
used}

\item{type}{what type of statistic should be calculated; can be t2data
(for data coverage), t2mean (for difference from a mean) or
"c2data" (for coverage calculated with the chi squared statistic)}

\item{labels}{Optional labels to use on the plot instead of rownames}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row per point including the columns d2
(squared mahalanobis distance)
t2crit (critical T squared value for the given level),
c2crit (critical X squared value for the given level)
and is_outlier
(logical, whether d2 > t2crit or d2 > c2crit, depending on type).
}
\description{
Calculate the T2 statistic or Mahalanobis distance for individual points
}
\details{
The function can use a robust estimator of location and scatter
using the \code{\link[robustbase]{covMcd}} function, which uses the
Maximum Covariance Determinant (MCD) estimator. Note that while this
results in ellipses which are more resistent to outliers, the
interpretation slightly changes, as the T2 statistic used is only an
approximation in this case. In other words, use it for visualisation and
QC, but not for statistical testing.
