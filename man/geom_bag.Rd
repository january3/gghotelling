\usage{
geom_bag(
  mapping = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  position = "identity",
  ...,
  what = c("bag", "loop"),
  type = c("hdepth", "projdepth", "sprojdepth", "dprojdepth"),
  na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{aes()}}. If specified and
\code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the default), it is combined with the default mapping
at the top level of the plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot
mapping.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
options:

If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
data as specified in the call to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot()}}.

A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
\code{\link[ggplot2:fortify]{fortify()}} for which variables will be created.

A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame}, and
will be used as the layer data. A \code{function} can be created
from a \code{formula} (e.g. \code{~ head(.x, 10)}).}

\item{position}{A position adjustment to use on the data for this layer. This
can be used in various ways, including to prevent overplotting and
improving the display. The \code{position} argument accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item The result of calling a position function, such as \code{position_jitter()}.
This method allows for passing extra arguments to the position.
\item A string naming the position adjustment. To give the position as a
string, strip the function name of the \code{position_} prefix. For example,
to use \code{position_jitter()}, give the position as \code{"jitter"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the position, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_positions]{layer position} documentation.
}}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to underlying \code{ggplot2::geom_polygon()}
or to \code{ggplot2::layer()}.}

\item{what}{What to plot. Either "bag" (the inner bag region) or "loop" (the outer loop).}

\item{type}{Determines the depth function used to construct the bagplot: 
              \code{"hdepth"} for halfspace depth, \code{"projdepth"} for projection depth, 
              \code{"sprojdepth"} for skewness-adjusted projection depth and 
              \code{"dprojdepth"} for directional projection depth. \cr
              Defaults to \code{"hdepth"}.
             }

\item{na.rm}{Logical. Should missing values be removed? Default is FALSE.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display. To include legend keys for all levels, even
when no data exists, use \code{TRUE}.  If \code{NA}, all levels are shown in legend,
but unobserved levels are omitted.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2:annotation_borders]{annotation_borders()}}.}

\description{
Bag plots for ggplot2
}
\details{
Bag plots are 2-dimensional generalizations of box plots. This geom adds
a bag region (which contains 50\% of the data points, just like the "box"
in "box plots") to the plot, plus the "loop" which can be used to
identify potential outliers.

geom_bag() is just a wrapper around the \code{[aplpack]{bagplot()}}
function which actually does the calculations, .and the arguments
are passed on to that function.

The geom either plots the inner "bag" or the outer "loop", but not both.
If you need both, you can add two geom_bag layers to your ggplot object.

\examples{
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_bag(aes(fill = Species), alpha = .1, what = "loop") +
  geom_bag(aes(fill = Species), alpha = .3)
