\title{Calculate the T2 statistic for individual points}
\usage{
hotelling_points(
  x,
  level = 0.95,
  robust = FALSE,
  type = c("t2data", "t2mean", "data")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix or data frame with two columns}

\item{level}{Either coverage probability (for type = "t2data" or "data") or
confidence level (for type = "t2mean").}

\item{robust}{If TRUE, then robust estimates of mean and covariance are
used}

\item{type}{what type of statistic should be calculated; can be t2data
(for data coverage), t2mean (for difference from a mean) or
"data" (for Mahalanobis distance)}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row per point including the columns t2 (t2
statistic), t2crit (critical t2 value for the given level) and is_outlier
(logical, whether t2 > t2crit).
}
\description{
Calculate the T2 statistic or Mahalanobis distance for individual points
}
\details{
The function can use a robust estimator of location and scatter
using the \code{\link[robustbase]{covMcd}} function, which uses the
Maximum Covariance Determinant (MCD) estimator. Note that while this
results in ellipses which are more resistent to outliers, the
interpretation slightly changes, as the T² statistic used is only an
approximation in this case. In other words, use it for visualisation and
QC, but not for statistical testing.
